Cluster Management System LAD/TORQUE
SIMPLE USER MANUAL
Last update: 18/08/2015

1. ladcomp

	Compiles of a parallel application to be executed in LAD clusters.

	Usage: ladcomp -env <environment> <sourcefile> -o <executable>

	Parameters:
	-env <environment>	compilation environment (
						mpicc for MPI over using C, 
						mpiompcc for MPI over using C with openmp,
						mpiCC for MPI using C++,
						mpiompCC for MPI using C++ with openmp,
						intelMPI for MPI using Intel C/C++ or
						intelMPIomp for MPI using Intel C/C++ with openmp)

	Example: ladcomp -env mpiCC hello.c -o hello

2. ladqview

	Shows information about the requests queue, like user names, start and finish times of the users,
	the number of available nodes and the allocation mode (exclusive or shared).

	Usage: ladqview [-c <cluster>]

	Parameters:
	-c <cluster>		cluster name

	Example: ladqview -c gates

3. ladalloc

	Allocates a set of nodes in a cluster for a specific amount of time in exclusive or shared mode.
	After completion, the user shell is redirected to the first node of the set of allocated nodes.
	If the user leaves the shell (using exit), the application under execution, if any,  will be aborted,
	and the allocated nodes are released.

	Usage: ladalloc -c <cluster> -n <nodes> -t <time> [-s|-e]

	Parameters:
	-c <cluster>		cluster name
	-n <nodes>		number of nodes
	-t <time>		amount of time for allocation
	[-s|-e]			shared or exclusive mode

	Example: ladalloc -c gates -n 3 -t 15 -e

4. ladrun

	Executes an application in a LAD cluster using allocated nodes.

	Usage: ladrun [-np <number_of_process>] [-net ether | inband] [-trace <output_directory>] <executable>

	Parameters:
	-np <number_of_process>		number of processes used to execute the application - if not
						specified, it use the maximum number of cores available
	-net ether | inband		network over ethernet or infiniband for communication between nodes
						(use if the selected machines has infiniband) - if not
						specified, it use both networks.
	-trace <output_directory>	directory to save MPI trace files generated by EZTrace during 
						application execution - if not specified, it will not use
						the EZTrace trace logger.

	Example: ladrun -np 2 -net inband -trace ./hello_MPITraces hello

5. ladinfo

	Shows information about the LAD clusters.

	Usage: ladinfo [ -c <cluster> || -all ]

	Parameters:
	-c <cluster>		cluster name
	-all			show information of all clusters

	Example: ladinfo -c gates
	Example: ladinfo -all

6. ladnodes

        Shows detailed information on your requested nodes: hostnames and their respective cores reserved, job IDs, requested and elapsed times.

        Usage: ladnodes
